### Overview
I was running into an increasing problem where my laptop would burn through all of my mobile data while I was working in the city, and I had to reset it which is very expensive, so I developed this app which will report on my network usage (up/down) within a time interval (currently set to 30 minutes).

I also used this project as an opportunity to practice the skills and concepts that I have dedicated a lot of time and focus to these past few months.

Future Plans:
- Track usage of specific applications and report if they use too much data
- Users can add "rules" (think how email rules work) to customise alerts based on certain conditions e.g. ApplicationName = x, Usage=1GB/5min
- List and provide an option to auto-terminate problem apps e.g. Steam

If I know when my computer is using a lot of data, I can pause and terminate any apps which are chewing through my data and save myself a ton of money and headache.

Pretty neat huh?
