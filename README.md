# Network Usage Tracker

### Stack: C# (.NET 6)

Console application built with C#. Displays a Toast Notification every 30 minutes notifying of the total data sent and received in that time.

I was running into an increasing problem where my laptop would burn through all of my mobile data while I was working in the city, and I had to reset it which is very expensive.

So I developed this app which will report on my network usage (up/down) within a time interval (currently set to 30 minutes).

Eventually I'll add a feature that let's me only have it notify me if I use a certain amount
of data such as 10GB in 30 minutes (definitely something worth checking).

If I know when my computer is using a lot of data, I can pause and investigate why.

Pretty neat huh?
